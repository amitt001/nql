Natural Query to SQL. Processing normal (day-to-day) English queries to Structured Query Language. 

**Underdevelopment and in the initial phase.**

Abstract
=========

Using query language for dealing with databases is always a professional and complex problem. However, in this project, we are creating this opportunity that each none professional user transfers his questions and requirements to a computer in natural language and derives his desired data by natural language processing. It first parses the input and then transforms that into query.

*Q. SQL has already formated English queries. Why I need something like this?*

A. With the explosion of data, we have more data than we can manage. It is clear that if people can ask their questions in a natural language then it will be much easier to use the data to get meaningful conclusions from it.
